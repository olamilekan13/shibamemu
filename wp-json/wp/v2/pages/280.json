If you are buying SHMU on your desktop, we recommend using MetaMask.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to Set Up Trust Wallet<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s a snapshot overview of how to set up Trust Wallet on your phone so that you can safely buy and store Shiba Memu tokens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 1. Download Official Trust Wallet App<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/trustwallet.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Trust Wallet<\/a> is a mobile wallet app backed by the Binance exchange. You can obtain the app via <a href=\"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.wallet.crypto.trustapp&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Play Store<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/trust-crypto-bitcoin-wallet\/id1288339409\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">App Store<\/a> \u2013 or access the download link on the Binance website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 2. Create Wallet<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You will now be asked if you already have a Trust Wallet or if you wish to create a new one. Click the \u2018Create a Wallet\u2019 button to create a new one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 3. Backup Passphrase<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Carefully note down your 12-word backup passphrase. Next, you must manually type the 12 words in the correct sequence so that Trust Wallet knows you have recorded the backup passphrase correctly. If your phone is lost or stolen, the only way for you to regain access to your Trust Wallet funds will be by entering this backup passphrase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 4. Add Shiba Memu Token<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that Trust Wallet is set up on your mobile device, you can add Shiba Memu tokens. Do this by clicking the \u201c+\u201d icon on top-right of the screen, followed by \u2018Add Custom Token\u2019 at the very bottom of the list. Your network will be selected as \u2018Ethereum\u2019 by default.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 5. Paste Shiba Memu Contract Address<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Paste your SHMU token contract address found on your Shiba Memu deposit page so that the Trust Wallet can locate your account. Double-check the contract address pasted. We recommend verifying your SHMU contract address using the official Shiba Memu Telegram group.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The blank fields will now populate with the correct contract specifics for Shiba Memu \u2013 such as the name, symbol, and number of decimals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s it. You have now successfully set up a Trust Wallet. You can connect your Trust Wallet directly to Uniswap and buy\/store your Shiba Memu tokens through a single app.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>To buy and store Shiba Memu tokens, you must have a top-rated, secured wallet that can connect to the Ethereum network.
