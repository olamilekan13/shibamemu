Installing MetaMask Wallet on your browser<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>MetaMask is available in two forms \u2013 a mobile app and a web browser extension. This guide explains the detailed setup process when using MetaMask via a browser extension. However, the process is similar to the setup process of the MetaMask app on <a href=\"https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/metamask-blockchain-wallet\/id1438144202\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">IOS<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=io.metamask&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Android<\/a> smartphones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step is to visit the MetaMask website and choose the browser on which you wish to install the wallet. The most common options are Chrome and Firefox.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 2. Create Wallet<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once installed, click the \u2018Create a Wallet\u2019 button.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 3. Create Password<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You will now be asked to create a password. Make sure your password is complex and alphanumeric.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 4. Keep a Record of the Recovery Phrase<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, you will be shown a recovery phrase that consists of 12 words. Write these 12 words down on a piece of paper and secure it in a safe place. If you or anyone enters these 12 words into MetaMask remotely, they will be able to access your wallet. So you must never share your 12-word MetaMask recovery phrase with anyone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 5. Connect to Ethereum Network<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>By default, MetaMask only allows you to transact with the Ethereum network. So there is no need to change the network within MetaMask to engage with the Shiba Memu token.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 6. Import Shiba Memu Token<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You will now need to import SHMU to your MetaMask wallet. You can do this by clicking on \u2018Import Tokens\u2019 and submitting the Shiba Memu contract address when announced. We recommend verifying the SHMU contract address using the official Shiba Memu Telegram group.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the token import process is completed, you can view the tokens on your MetaMask wallet that you bought during the pre-sale or via Uniswap.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Step 1.
